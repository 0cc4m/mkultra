    "This trainer takes datapoints in a \"call and response\" format. The \"call\" is a fixed prompt (e.g. \"A detailed description of the Spider Tank:\") that should elicit the \"response\" (a few paragraphs of information about the Spider Tank). Multiple responses can be specified for each call, but loss is only calculated against the responses.\n",

    "The trainer will optimize a soft prompt such that the call is followed by the response. The combined call and response is moved randomly within the context window to prevent overfitting, and the gap is filled with random tokens.\n",

    "- Rather than describing the subject in grammatically correct sentences, try a word cloud approach.\n",
    "- Rather than describing the subject, provide implicit examples of to write about it (\"John doffed his black top hat and cleaned it with his white handkerchief\")\n",
    "- Consider the use of the subject's proper noun vs its pronouns. (Should you start every sentence with \"John Doe\", or a mix of \"John\" and \"He\"?)\n",
    "- Definitely use the min_loss parameter to arrest the tuning."
